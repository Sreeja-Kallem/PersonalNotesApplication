# PersonalNotesApplication
This is a very simple demo app to get a hands-on-experience and is useful for creating your own notes.

Let do a quick walkthrough for the code: we have two activities here, one is MainActivity and the other is NotesActivity. MainActivity consists of logic to create a note, put data into it using shared preferences and to delete a note whereas NotesActivity retrieves the data that is stored in shared preferences. We have also inflated a menu option that helps us to create a new note. Initially when launched and no notes are available, It automatically creates a sample note. You can long press on a note to delete it which pops up an AlertDialogue box.
